*"No Hell"* pronounces like *"NoÃ«l"* in French, meaning *"Christmas"* lights.

While this project looks focused on interacting with LED lights, this repository is also a fun way to touch on the below technology:

- Electronic (with very little soldering)
- Arduino IDE coding (C-like) using ESP8266 supporting Wifi
- REST API Designs
- Web-sockets programming
- Web UI - TBD: VueJS UI ?
- Open CV for a little of Machine Learning tools - TBD
- Android - TBD

In short, this repository demonstrate all above topics are "no hell".

== Led Strips

=== Material

* WS2812b comes in 5v or 12v.

[WARNING]
====
12v are hooked 3 by 3, which means that programmatically there are 3 times less leds.
====

Each led consumes 0.2W max, to be safe count 20W for 60 led, that is 20W per meter.

I use 5v 150W power supply so that 10m 600 led strip is fine.

* WS2815 is enhancement of WS2812b (12v with individual address, and with sustain led failure)

* SK6812 is 5v, and has a 4th channel for white light, available in cold or warm white

==== Wiring

Using Arduino Pro Mini 5v as reference.

Wiring for ESP8266 or ESP32 is same as stated below.

As stated in NeoPixel library:

[IMPORTANT]
====
To reduce NeoPixel burnout risk, add 1000 uF capacitor across
pixel power leads, add 300 - 500 Ohm resistor on first pixel's data input
and minimize distance between Arduino and first pixel.  Avoid connecting
on a live circuit...if you must, connect GND first.
====

Then just hook up data pin to one of the pin of arduino.

[NOTE]
====
For 12v strips, make sure not to burn the arduino 5v: don't hook the Vcc !
